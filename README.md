# twitter-multithreading-api

In this script I implement a multithreading solution for increasing Twitter API rate limits. It could be seen as an abstract layer server on top of tweepy/api single account use. Its main use case if to deal with a hugh bunch of tasks such as downloading a list of user profiles by ID. Since each API account has its own rate limits, you can scale your app thought creating more accounts. Each API account is assigned to a thread, which continuously consumes new tasks and perform the desired functions. It allows drastically reducing both api call and processing times as long as you add new accounts (with 5 accounts you can download 5000 followers lists per day instead of 1000).
